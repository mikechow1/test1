//Accessing Objects Properties with Bracket Notatio

/*
The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation ([]). If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in it, you will need to use bracket notation.

Here is a sample of using bracket notation to read an object property:

var myObj = {
  "Space Name": "Kirk",
  "More Space": "Spock"
};

myObj["Space Name"]; // Kirk
myObj['More Space']; // Spock

Note that property names with spaces in them must be in quotes (single or double).

Instructions
Read the values of the properties "an entree" and "the drink" of testObj using bracket notation and assign them to entreeValue and drinkValue respectively.
*/

var testObj = {
	"an entree" : "hamburger",
	"my side": "veggies",
	"the drink" : "water"
};


testObj["an entree"];
testObj["the drink"];
