Decrementing while-loop:
Although pretty verbose, this solution does have its advantages over solution one. You’re not creating an array and you’re just concatenating a string based on characters from the source string.

From a performance perspective, this one would probably yield the best results (although untested). For extremely long strings, the performance gains might drop out the window though.
