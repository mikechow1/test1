//Record Collection

/*
You are given a JSON object representing (a small part of) your record collection. Each album is identified by a unique id number (its key) and has several properties. Not all albums have complete information.
Write a function which takes an id, a property (prop), and a value.

For the given id in collection:
If prop does not contain the key "tracks", then update or set the value for that incomplete prop.
If prop does not contain the key "tracks" before you update it, create an empty array before pushing a track to it.
If prop does contain the key "tracks" and its value is non-blank, then push the value onto the end of its existing tracks array.
If value is blank, delete that prop.
Always return the entire collection object.

Hints
Use bracket notation when accessing object properties with variables.
Push is an array method you can read about on Mozilla Developer Network.
You may refer back to Manipulating Complex ObjectsIntroducing JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) for a refresher.
