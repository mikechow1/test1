//Manipulating Complex Objects

/*
JavaScript objects are flexible because they allow for Data Structures with arbitrary combinations of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, functions, and objects.
*/

/*
Note
You will need a comma in between objects with more than one object in the array.

JavaScript Object Notation or JSON is a data interchange format used to store data (source: json.org).

A property is the part of an object that associates a key (either a String value or a Symbol value) and a value (source: ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-property). So, a property consists of a key - value pair. (source: spacetelescope.github.io/understanding-json-schema/reference/object.html#properties). Property keys (also known as names) should be in quotation marks.

Like JavaScript Objects, JSON is flexible because it is heterogeneous, meaning it permits Data Structures with arbitrary combinations of strings, booleans, numbers, arrays, and objects.

Here is an example of a JSON object:

var ourMusic = [
  {
    "artist": "Daft Punk",
    "title": "Homework",
    "release_year": 1997,
    "formats": [ 
      "CD", 
      "Cassette", 
      "LP" ],
    "gold": true
  }
];
This is an array of objects and the object has various pieces of metadata about an album. It also has a nested formats array. Additional album records could be added to the top level array.

Note
You will need to place a comma in between objects in JSON unless there is only one object in the array or containing object.

Instructions
Add a new album to the myMusic object. Add artist and title strings, release_year number, and a formats array of strings.
*/

var myMusic = [
  {
    "artist": "Billy Joel",
    "title": "Piano Man",
    "release_year": 1973,
    "formats": [ 
      "CS", 
      "8T", 
      "LP" ],
    "gold": true
  },
  
  {
  	"artist": "Bill J",
    "title": "Man",
    "release_year": 1974,
    "formats": [ 
      "CS", 
      "8T", 
      "LP" ],
    "gold": true
  }
];
