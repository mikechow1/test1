//Build JavaScript Objects

/*
Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.

Here's a sample object:

var cat = {
  "name": "Whiskers",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
};

Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.

Instructions
Make an object that represents a dog called myDog which contains the properties "name" (a string), "legs", "tails" and "friends".

You can set these object properties to whatever values you want, as long "name" is a string, "legs" and "tails" are numbers, and "friends" is an array.
*/

var myDog = {
  "name": "camp",
  "legs":4,
  "tails":1,
  "friends": ["cat"]
};
